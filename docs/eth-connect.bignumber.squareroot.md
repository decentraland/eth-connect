## BigNumber.squareRoot() method

Returns a BigNumber whose value is the square root of the value of this BigNumber, rounded according to the current `DECIMAL_PLACES` and `ROUNDING_MODE` settings.

The return value will be correctly rounded, i.e. rounded as if the result was first calculated to an infinite number of correct digits before rounding.

```ts
x = new BigNumber(16)
x.squareRoot()                  // '4'
y = new BigNumber(3)
y.squareRoot()                  // '1.73205080756887729353'
```

**Signature:**

```typescript
squareRoot(): BigNumber;
```
**Returns:**
