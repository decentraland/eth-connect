The sign method calculates an Ethereum specific signature with:

sign(keccak256("Ethereum Signed Message:" + len(message) + message))).

By adding a prefix to the message makes the calculated signature recognisable as an Ethereum specific signature. This prevents misuse where a malicious DApp can sign arbitrary data (e.g. transaction) and use the signature to impersonate the victim.

Note the address to sign with must be unlocked.

**Signature:**

```typescript
eth_sign: (address: Address, message: Data) => Promise<Data>;
```
