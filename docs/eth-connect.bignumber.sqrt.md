## BigNumber.sqrt() method

Returns a BigNumber whose value is the square root of the value of this BigNumber, rounded according to the current `DECIMAL_PLACES` and `ROUNDING_MODE` settings.

The return value will be correctly rounded, i.e. rounded as if the result was first calculated to an infinite number of correct digits before rounding.

```ts
x = new BigNumber(16)
