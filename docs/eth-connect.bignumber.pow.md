## BigNumber.pow() method

Returns a BigNumber whose value is the value of this BigNumber exponentiated by `n`<!-- -->, i.e. raised to the power `n`<!-- -->, and optionally modulo a modulus `m`<!-- -->.

If `n` is negative the result is rounded according to the current `DECIMAL_PLACES` and `ROUNDING_MODE` settings.

As the number of digits of the result of the power operation can grow so large so quickly, e.g. 123.456\*\*10000 has over 50000 digits, the number of significant digits calculated is limited to the value of the `POW_PRECISION` setting (unless a modulus `m` is specified).

By default `POW_PRECISION` is set to 0. This means that an unlimited number of significant digits will be calculated, and that the method's performance will decrease dramatically for larger exponents.

If `m` is specified and the value of `m`<!-- -->, `n` and this BigNumber are integers and `n` is positive, then a fast modular exponentiation algorithm is used, otherwise the operation will be performed as `x.pow(n).modulo(m)` with a `POW_PRECISION` of 0.

Throws if `n` is not an integer.

```ts
Math.pow(0.7, 2)                   // 0.48999999999999994
x = new BigNumber(0.7)
x.pow(2)                           // '0.49'
BigNumber(3).pow(-2)               // '0.11111111111111111111'
```
