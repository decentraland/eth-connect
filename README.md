_eth-connect_ is a TypeScript-based [web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) library alternative which implements the [Generic JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) spec as well.

You can follow the [JavaScript API documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API) until TypeScript docs are released.


## Design goals

- A Typed web3.js alternative
- Have as few convention-invented functions as possible (by following the RPC specs as much as possible)
- Leverage WS and HTTP providers
- Portable (support and work equally in both browser and node)
- Painless `eth` usage: Using contract factories, well-split event types (block, transaction and contracts plus topics)
- `async/await` out of the box

## Installation

Using NPM:

```bash
npm i eth-connect
```

Importing as a browser module:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/eth-connect@latest/eth-connect.js"></script>
```

## Examples

Below are some simple illustrative examples.
You can also find more complete examples are in the integration `/tests` folder.

### Initialize with a provider

```ts
import { RequestManager } from 'eth-connect'

// using the injected MetaMask provider
const requestManager = new RequestManager(web3.currentProvider)

const myBalance = await requestManager.eth_getBalance(myAddress)
```

or

```ts
import { RequestManager, HTTPProvider } from 'eth-connect'

const provider = 'my-own-RPC-url'
const providerInstance = new HTTPProvider(provider)
const requestManager = new RequestManager(providerInstance)

const someBalance = await requestManager.eth_getBalance(someAddress)
```

### Initialize a contract

```ts
import { RequestManager, ContractFactory } from 'eth-connect'

const abi = require('./some-contract-abi.json')
// using the injected MetaMask provider
const requestManager = new RequestManager(web3.currentProvider)

const factory = new ContractFactory(requestManager, abi)
const instance = await factory.at(address)

console.log('Calling a method', await instance.mint(myAddress))
```

### Get the accounts

```ts
import { RequestManager } from 'eth-connect'

const requestManager = new RequestManager(web3.currentProvider)

const accounts = await requestManager.eth_accounts()
```
